Challenges faced in the DIFFUSION OF RENEWABLE power technology & alternative of FOSSIL FUELS
Installation charges need to be improved. since the gadgets used to supply renewable strength assets are generally new gadgets, their costs are high. similarly, for the reason that it’s miles nonetheless no longer the dominant electricity type in percent, the fees aren’t effortlessly reflected in unit charges as a reduction.

aside from this, technically renewable strength has some negative aspects. seeing that such assets are tremendously suffering from environmental outcomes and herbal events, they create uncertainty. In power manufacturing, the stability of delivery and call for is very critical, and because it isn’t feasible to keep the system alive, it’s miles vital to use a greater balanced strength as the main system or to display and manipulate unbalanced systems with more era.
Renewable electricity assist mechanisms are made as regulatory guidelines and monetary incentives.
within the regulatory policies, the tariff guarantee given to the producers to buy at a unit charge for a positive period of time, for an area wherein a license or soft is made; The green certificates, which guarantee that a positive amount of the energy manufacturing gained via the manufacturer with the lowest bid on the idea of kWh electricity production is made from the renewable strength quota, and the netting methods that make the offsetting between the production points’ giving the extra power electricity to the network to which they’re connected and receiving strength from the grid when the production isn’t sufficient, are protected.
Economic incentives; capital subsidies, offers/reductions, exemption from investment and manufacturing taxes, tax discounts such as income, energy, carbon dioxide, VAT, strength production bills, public investment, loans, grants, and competitive bidding.
